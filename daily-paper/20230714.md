## Paper 1 : Safe DreamerV3: Safe Reinforcement Learning with World Models
- _**Keywords**_: reinforcement learning
- _**Abstract**_: The widespread application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world situations is yet to come to fruition, largely as a result of its failure to satisfy the essential safety demands of such systems. Existing safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) methods, employing cost functions to enhance safety, fail to achieve zero-cost in complex scenarios, including vision-only tasks, even with comprehensive data sampling and training. To address this, we introduce Safe DreamerV3, a novel algorithm that integrates both Lagrangian-based and planning-based methods within a world model. Our methodology represents a significant advancement in SafeRL as the first algorithm to achieve nearly zero-cost in both low-dimensional and vision-only tasks within the Safety-Gymnasium benchmark.

## Paper 2 : Reinforcement Learning with Frontier-Based Exploration via Autonomous Environment
- _**Keywords**_: reinforcement learning
- _**Abstract**_: Active Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical problem in autonomous robotics, enabling robots to navigate to new regions while building an accurate model of their surroundings. Visual SLAM is a popular technique that uses virtual elements to enhance the experience. However, existing frontier-based exploration strategies can lead to a non-optimal path in scenarios where there are multiple frontiers with similar distance. This issue can impact the efficiency and accuracy of Visual SLAM, which is crucial for a wide range of robotic applications, such as search and rescue, exploration, and mapping. To address this issue, this research combines both an existing Visual-Graph SLAM known as ExploreORB with reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm allows the robot to learn and optimize exploration routes through a reward-based system to create an accurate map of the environment with proper frontier selection. Frontier-based exploration is used to detect unexplored areas, while reinforcement learning optimizes the robot's movement by assigning rewards for optimal frontier points. Graph SLAM is then used to integrate the robot's sensory data and build an accurate map of the environment. The proposed algorithm aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of ExploreORB by optimizing the exploration process of frontiers to build a more accurate map. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments will be conducted in various virtual environments using Gazebo, a robot simulation software. Results of these experiments will be compared with existing methods to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach as an optimal solution for SLAM in autonomous robotics.

## Paper 3 : PiTL: Cross-modal Retrieval with Weakly-supervised Vision-language Pre-training via Prompting
- _**Keywords**_: vision-language, LLM
- _**Abstract**_: Vision-language (VL) Pre-training (VLP) has shown to well generalize VL models over a wide range of VL downstream tasks, especially for cross-modal retrieval. However, it hinges on a huge amount of image-text pairs, which requires tedious and costly curation. On the contrary, weakly-supervised VLP (W-VLP) explores means with object tags generated by a pre-trained object detector (OD) from images. Yet, they still require paired information, i.e. images and object-level annotations, as supervision to train an OD.   To further reduce the amount of supervision, we propose Prompts-in-The-Loop (PiTL) that prompts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to describe images. Concretely, given a category label of an image, e.g. refinery, the knowledge, e.g. a refinery could be seen with large storage tanks, pipework, and ..., extracted by LLMs is used as the language counterpart. The knowledge supplements, e.g. the common relations among entities most likely appearing in a scene. We create IN14K, a new VL dataset of 9M images and 1M descriptions of 14K categories from ImageNet21K with PiTL. Empirically, the VL models pre-trained with PiTL-generated pairs are strongly favored over other W-VLP works on image-to-text (I2T) and text-to-image (T2I) retrieval tasks, with less supervision. The results reveal the effectiveness of PiTL-generated pairs for VLP.

## Paper 4 : Generating Efficient Training Data via LLM-based Attribute Manipulation
- _**Keywords**_: manipulation, LLM
- _**Abstract**_: In this paper, we propose a novel method, Chain-of-Thoughts Attribute Manipulation (CoTAM), to guide few-shot learning by carefully crafted data from Large Language Models (LLMs). The main idea is to create data with changes only in the attribute targeted by the task. Inspired by facial attribute manipulation, our approach generates label-switched data by leveraging LLMs to manipulate task-specific attributes and reconstruct new sentences in a controlled manner. Instead of conventional latent representation controlling, we implement chain-of-thoughts decomposition and reconstruction to adapt the procedure to LLMs. Extensive results on text classification and other tasks verify the advantage of CoTAM over other LLM-based text generation methods with the same number of training examples. Analysis visualizes the attribute manipulation effectiveness of CoTAM and presents the potential of LLM-guided learning with even less supervision.
